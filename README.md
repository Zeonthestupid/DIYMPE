# DIYMPE

Alright so for reference, this is for a school project, therefor it will not be fully public until finished


This project was eventually scrapped, although most of it was working. 
----
So what I did was take a wii nunchuck and used a rewired wii nc adaptor into my arduino leonardo.
Then I sent midi CC signals to my computer through the leonerdo, depending on the pitch, roll, joystick and buttons of the nunchuck
(I also sent values such as pitch bend and aftertouch on channel 1)
